// amazon-cognito-identity-js-node does not seem to be the standard way for backend passport strategies
// Instead, a common approach for Cognito with Passport is to use passport-jwt and verify tokens
// issued by Cognito. If Cognito is the primary IdP and local user store is minimal or synced,
// this strategy would validate Cognito JWTs.

// If the goal is to use Cognito's *hosted UI* and redirect flows, then a passport-cognito-oauth2 or similar
// OpenID Connect / OAuth2 strategy would be used, which is more complex.

// Given the SDS mentions CognitoService for signup/initiateAuth, it implies Cognito might be
// directly integrated rather than just validating its JWTs post-auth.
// A "CognitoStrategy" might directly call CognitoService.initiateAuth.
// However, standard Passport strategies usually verify credentials/tokens, not initiate auth flows.

// For this iteration, let's assume a simple scenario where this strategy might be a custom one
// that could fit into a Passport flow, perhaps for a specific grant type or custom Cognito interaction.
// A more typical setup would be:
// 1. Frontend uses AWS Amplify or amazon-cognito-identity-js to talk to Cognito.
// 2. Cognito issues JWTs.
// 3. Frontend sends JWT to NestJS backend.
// 4. NestJS uses a `passport-jwt` strategy configured with Cognito's User Pool keys to validate the JWT.

// The SDS lists this strategy alongside `CognitoService` with methods like `signUp`, `initiateAuth`.
// This suggests a direct integration. A true Passport strategy for this would be complex.
// Let's create a placeholder that acknowledges this complexity.

import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';
// No standard 'Strategy' from a 'passport-cognito' library is widely adopted for direct username/password flow.
// We might be creating a custom strategy.
import { Strategy as CustomStrategy } from 'passport-custom'; // Example, actual base strategy might differ

import { UserAuthConfigService } from '../../config/user-auth.config';

  constructor(
    private readonly cognitoService: CognitoService,
    private readonly configService: UserAuthConfigService,
    ) {
    super(); // Custom strategy might not need super call or specific options here
  }

  // The `validate` method for a custom strategy depends heavily on how it's invoked.
  // If it were to handle username/password against Cognito:
  async validate(req: any): Promise<any> {
    // This is highly dependent on the use case.
    // If this strategy is meant to proxy auth to Cognito:
    const { email, password } = req.body; // Assuming these are passed in request

      if (authResult.AuthenticationResult?.IdToken) {
        // Here you might create/lookup a local user based on Cognito's response
        // and return that user, or return a payload derived from Cognito tokens.
        // For simplicity, returning the raw auth result or a part of it.
        return { 
            cognitoUserSub: authResult.ChallengeParameters?.USER_ID_FOR_SRP, // Example, depends on auth flow
            idToken: authResult.AuthenticationResult.IdToken,
            // ... other relevant user data or tokens
        };
      } else if (authResult.ChallengeName) {
        // Handle MFA, new password required, etc.
        // This is where it gets complex for a single strategy `validate` method.
        // Typically, the controller would call `respondToAuthChallenge`.
        throw new UnauthorizedException(`Cognito challenge: ${authResult.ChallengeName}`);
      }
      throw new UnauthorizedException('Cognito authentication failed.');
    } catch (error) {

// Note: A more common pattern for Cognito + NestJS backend is:
// 1. Frontend (e.g., using Amplify) authenticates with Cognito.
// 2. Frontend receives JWTs from Cognito.
// 3. Frontend sends JWT (IdToken or AccessToken) to NestJS API.
// 4. NestJS uses a JwtStrategy (passport-jwt) configured to validate these Cognito-issued JWTs.
//    This involves setting up the jwksUri for your Cognito User Pool.
// This `CognitoStrategy` as a direct username/password handler via Passport is less standard.
