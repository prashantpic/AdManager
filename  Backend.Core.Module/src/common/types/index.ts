// This file serves as a barrel export for common types and type definitions.
// For `environment.d.ts`, it augments a global namespace, so direct export isn't typical.
export {};

// If you have other specific utility types, you can define and export them here.
// For example:
// export type Nullable<T> = T | null;
// export type Optional<T> = T | undefined;
